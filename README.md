# STUDENT ACADEMIC SUCCESS PREDICTION
Student success can be significantly improved through the early detection of struggling students and the taking of preventive measures. Studies have shown that Machine Learning (ML) has the potential to help address challenges like academic underachievement, dropout rates, and graduation delays. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social, and school-related features, and it was collected using school reports and questionnaires. 

I have classified these students using five well-known ML ensemble models into two categories, "successful" and "not-successful" according to their average grade score performance. Then I compared the test accuracy performance of five well-known ML ensemble models, including support vector machines (SVMs), Decision Trees, Adaptive Boosting, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting. The results of the comparative analysis indicate that Random Forest provides the highest test accuracy of 73.20%.
